# C++ Internship Tasks

This repo contains three simple C++ programs I created for my internship at Sumaonix.

- `task1_student.cpp`: Calculates student grade based on marks.
- `task2_book.cpp`: Adds, displays, and searches book details.
- `task3_bankaccount.cpp`: A basic bank account system with deposit, withdraw, and balance features.

Each file runs separately and has its own `main()` function.

To run, compile any file using g++ and execute the output.

Thanks for visiting!
